NOTE: Although icecream will compile on some non-Linux systems,
it depends critically on Linux' /proc/ structures and will fail
at runtime until somebody figures out how to emulate the "ticks"
form of process accounting in there.

Required Libraries
==================
Note: The package name may vary by distro
* libcap-ng-devel
* libarchive-devel
* lzo-devel
* libzstd-devel

How to install icecream
=======================

cd icecream
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/opt/icecream
make
make install

WARNING: Make sure you specify a prefix, otherwise icecream
might override your gcc installation! You will need to use this
prefix instead of /usr when referring to icecream (for example
when extending the $PATH variable).

The documentation is maintained in README.md for the time being.

Host to build/install with cmake
================================

WARNING, the cmake build is a work in progress, it probably doesn't even 
complete. Even if you somehow get a successful build that does not mean that
the build actually will work. There are many known issues.  Bug reports will
not be accepted.

cd icecream
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/icecream -DBUILD_EXPIRIMENTAL=true ..
make -j 4
